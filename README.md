Spring_MICROSERVICES - No database and no communication between services

MICROSERVICES_PROJECT - Database and communication between services

For Spring_MICROSERVCIES there is no database and no communication between services. Also if you directly clone or download this git folder, inorder to run mvnw command you need to do chmod 700 mvnw for all for services because permission for running mvnw will be denied initially

For MICROSERVICES_PROJECT i have used java 11 so do not download this one instead do spring initializer and choose java 8 and then copy the required stuff
